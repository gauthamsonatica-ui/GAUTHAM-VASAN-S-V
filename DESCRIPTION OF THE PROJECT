📊 Cross Market Analysis Project
📌 Project Overview

This project performs cross-market financial analysis by collecting, storing, and visualizing data from cryptocurrency markets, stock indices, and oil prices.
It uses APIs, SQLite, and Streamlit to build an end-to-end data pipeline and interactive dashboard.

Markets covered:

Cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Top 250 coins)

Stock Indices (S&P 500, NASDAQ, NIFTY 50)

Oil Prices (WTI Crude)

🧠 What This File Does (High-Level Flow)

Fetches real-time & historical data from APIs

Cleans and structures the data using Pandas

Stores data in an SQLite database

Builds a Streamlit web app for visualization & SQL analysis

(Optional) Exposes the app using Cloudflare Tunnel

🔄 Step-by-Step Explanation of the Code
Step 1: Fetch Cryptocurrency Market Data

Uses CoinGecko API

Fetches top 250 cryptocurrencies

Extracts:

Price

Market cap

Rank

Supply

ATH / ATL

Converts data into a Pandas DataFrame

https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets

Step 2: Fetch Crypto Historical Prices

Retrieves 365 days of price data for:

Bitcoin

Ethereum

Tether

Converts timestamps to readable dates

Step 3: Fetch Oil Price Data

Source: GitHub open dataset (WTI Crude Oil)

Filters data between 2020 – 2026

Step 4: Fetch Stock Market Data

Uses Yahoo Finance API via yfinance

Indices:

^GSPC → S&P 500

^IXIC → NASDAQ

^NSEI → NIFTY 50

Data collected:

Open

High

Low

Close

Volume

Step 5: Store Data in SQLite Database

Creates datascienceproject.db with tables:

Table Name	Description
cryptocurrencies	Crypto metadata
crypto_prices	Historical crypto prices
oil_prices	Oil prices
stock_prices	Stock index prices
combined_stocks_prices	Merged stock data
Step 6: Streamlit Application

The app provides:
